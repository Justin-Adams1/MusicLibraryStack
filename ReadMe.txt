This project was the first time really playing around with React, and learning how to interact with the virtual DOM. 

You can see how I played around with rendering a list, and getting the data to refresh. I remember seeing the list update in real time with the search, and being very impressed.

Please feel free to check out my other projects for an idea of how I progressed through coding bootcamp!
